# Detailed solution

On reaching Privency website when the MVP is ready, anyone can browse the existing public surveys and their results. Participating in surveys is restricted to users who can prove they hold the right credentials (eligibility). Eligibility is verified in a privacy-preserving way using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). On the MVP, a survey on Privency is a unique multiple-choice question that allows respondents to write one accompanying comment. By default, surveys are public. The frontend explicitly displays cryptographic proof of the authenticity of the data, with external links to IPFS and Ethereum explorers when necessary.

## How does Privency unlocks the possibility for surveys to be proposed from bottom-up?

When a social group is created, members agree on an authority (the Issuer) whose first task is to recognize its members (the Holders). Members receive credentials that they can show to anyone that desires to verify their membership (the Verifiers). This pattern is called the Issuer-Holder-Verifier pattern, and has been standardized by the W3C, especially with Decentralized Identifiers, Verifiable Credentials (VC) and OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance. This suite of technology is what enables bottom-up survey proposals to be technically possible.

In the MVP, Privency acts as a Verifier that allows any Holder who can prove ownership of a Verifiable Credential to create surveys that only other members of the community can reply to. To ensure Holder’s anonymity, Privency expects Hyperledger AnonCreds as Verifiable Presentation. Hyperledger AnonCreds is a widely used VC format that adds privacy-protecting ZKP to the core VC issuance. Survey proposers can further restrict the participation eligibility to a subset of the members of their community, which technically translates into enforcing the voters to provide a specific type of Verifiable Presentation for their vote to count.

The unicity of voters is ensured by enforcing the presentation of a survey-specific hash calculated from the unique Holder’s AnonCred `link_secret` (and the associated ZKP). This technique makes sure that Holders’ votes on multiple surveys cannot be correlated to each other, and that Holders who try to DDoS Privency by abusing the voting endpoint can be suspended or banned from responding to that survey.

To propose a survey, Holders are required to present a hash calculated from their unique AnonCred `link_secret` using a method that can generate up to 10 different hashes per Holder. Using this technique, bad actors who try to abuse Privency by publishing hateful surveys or engaging in DDoS attacks can be suspended or banned. That means Holders have at most 10 unique pseudonymous identities that they can use to propose surveys. This number is not definitive. It boils down to a trade-off between ensuring the service resistance to cyber-attacks and maximizing users' privacy.
To ensure that voters don’t inadvertently reveal their identity via their comments, Privency innovates by automatically anonymizing both the content and style of their speech in a privacy-preserving way before storing the comment. This is achieved by running a Large Language Model (OpenChatKit) trained for this specific purpose behind Fully-Homomorphic Encryption (Concrete ML): FHE enables processing encrypted data. Besides anonymizing speech, the LLM will be used to help with moderation by flagging hate speech.

## How does Privency solves the technical trilemma?

The usage of the decentralized identity primitives described above provides both privacy and proof of eligibility to our surveys. But how do we make sure that anyone can independently verify the authenticity of data and processing? Privency relies on Snapshot to achieve this challenge. 

Snapshot is an off-chain voting platform where the data associated with every vote is publicly pinned on IPFS. IPFS is a content-addressed peer-to-peer network, meaning that it is censorship-resistant: it only takes one person to pin data for it to be available. Data is verifiable because it is content addressed. Privency runs its own snapshot-hub and IPFS node to quickly provide a proof to the voter on the frontend that their data has been correctly pinned. Privency only publishes hashed data to Snapshot. When users fetch data of a survey on Privency frontend, they can locally verify that it corresponds exactly to the hashes pinned on IPFS and replay the result themselves.

Traditionally, Snapshot votes are based on the number and nature of tokens in an Ethereum account. Privency innovates by counting Snapshot votes based on AnonCreds included in the Ethereum signatures instead of tokens.
