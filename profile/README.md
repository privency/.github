# ZKorum - The Next Generation Survey Tool

There is an ever growing need to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in our societies. However, it is difficult for people to share what they truly experience or think when subject to the fear of judgment. Anonymous surveys today either do not verify if a respondent is eligible to participate or they do so at the expense of the respondent's privacy. The lack of privacy could lead to self-censorship, while the lack of transparency in how data is processed and manipulated could lead to censorship.

_ZKorum_, proposes a survey solution that empowers all people, especially those who are vulnerable and underrepresented, to speak up and be heard by bringing together the following key innovations in a powerful combination:

- Bottom-up approach: instead of leadership conducting top-down surveys, anyone holding a private eligible credential can start one.
- Privacy-preserving self-sovereign identity open standards: Verifiable Credentials
- The votes inherits from the censorship-resistance property of IPFS, a content-addressed peer-to-peer network.

With ZKorum, people can freely express their opinions and initiate their own discussions and votes without worrying about revealing their identities, _even to ZKorum_. Anyone can verify the authenticity of information without the need to trust. Leadership can acquire honest insights about their communities and publish results that guarantee authenticity.

In the short term, ZKorum targets corporate clients and educational institutions which seek to promote DEI within their communities. In the long run, Privency aspires to work with governments to become a trustless gateway to eDemocracy that revolutionizes public survey, polling, and voting.

ZKorum is an [Open Startup](https://cal.com/blog/open-startup) at the ideation stage, that is actively built in public by @nicobao.

The [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) as well as this document are continuously updated.

## What problems are we solving?

ZKorum proposes a survey solution that empowers all people, especially those who are vulnerable and underrepresented, to speak up and be heard.

The first aspect of ZKorum’s solution is a bottom-up approach to opinion surveys. For example, to gather insights about workspace experience, most companies conduct top-down DEI surveys by giving employees questionnaires. Privency proposes a democratic approach, which allows employees to anonymously initiate their own surveys, votes, and discussions.

Another aspect that ZKorum addresses is the technical trilemma between privacy, proof of eligibility and trust-minimized infrastructure. Here are the three possible scenarios:

- Scenario 1 Privacy + Proof of eligibility: A third party is introduced to verify the respondent’s eligibility. Survey results cannot be independently cryptographically verified. Respondents have no other choice but to trust the third-party in handling their data. Example: IFOP, the largest French polling and market research firm.
- Scenario 2 Privacy + Trust-minimized infrastructure: without proving the eligibility of respondents, results are subject to spams and noises and become unusable. Example: Snapshot votes open to any Ethereum address.
- Scenario 3 Proof of eligibility + Trust-minimized infrastructure: Respondents need to deliver more personal information than necessary to prove eligibility. Example: Snapshot votes open to specific KYCed Ethereum addresses.

ZKorum tackles this trilemma by combining recent breakthroughs in decentralized identity and trust-minimized infrastructure, reclaiming the original role of the web as a neutral freedom-enabling technology where we can do _more_ than in real life.
