# ZKorum - Democratize Democracy

**ZKorum (ZK + Forum)** is dedicated to developing open-source solutions and products to **rehumanize** and **depolarize** the online social landscape.

At ZKorum, we believe that social media should be a safe and open space where we are in control of our **identities** and **data**, **free** to express our opinions, and encouraged to **think critically and constructively**.

Our building blocks:
- **Zero Knowledge Proof cryptography (ZK)** to ensure user privacy and data trustworthiness
- **Trust-minimized infrastructure** to provide auditable moderation
- **Bridging based ranking** algorithm to identify and promote voices that bridge divides (as opposed to engagement based algorithms nown to fuel polariztions)

Our core product:

- 𝗔𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗮: an eDemocracy platform where users participate in anonymous discussions and polls within their country or city. Users are verified by ZK Proof of Passport, or Verifiable Credentials.

ZKorum is currently at the development stage, and is actively [built in public](https://github.com/zkorum/zkorum). The [technical feasibility](https://github.com/zkorum/poc/tree/main/vc-flow#how-does-it-work) and [research & development](https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts/pull/19) have been validated.

The [Roadmap](https://github.com/zkorum/.github/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) as well as this document are continuously updated.

## Detailed solution

**Agora** is an online forum where communities and verified members can create and participate in anonymous polls, surveys, discussions, and votes. On reaching the  Progressive Web App (PWA), anyone can browse the existing public surveys and their results. For example, a public poll asking European residents from 18 to 60 years old if they will choose an Electric Vehicle over a gas one. By default, surveys are publicly visible. Participating in surveys is restricted to users who can prove they hold the right credentials (eligibility). Eligibility is verified in a privacy-preserving way using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) of users’ Anonymous Credentials (Dock’s BBS+ W3C Verifiable Credentials).
