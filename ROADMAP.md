# Roadmap

This roadmap is continuously updated.

## Note

## Continuously

- blogging every week about the advancement of the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/privency/weekly-updates)
- posting short updates few times a week on LinkedIn and Twitter and post links to the blog posts
- eventually doing 1 or 2 tutorial / video explainer
- trying to speak at conferences

## Objective #1: proof-of-concept

Deadline
- the 1st of August 2023 (~3 months of work)

Goals:
- Convince potential users, collaborators, investors and myself of Privency's vision & technical viability

Non-goals:
- good software quality (successful or not, the PoC will be thrown away)
- high number of features
- beautiful design
- production-grade security (though we must convince that Privency *can* be secure, given enough engineering time)

The PoC consists of independent open-source projects to showcase:
- the flow from the issuing of a VC to the authorization of REST endpoints based on AnonCreds
- the Snapshot voting strategy that replaces tokens with AnonCreds 
- a speech anonymizer that computes encrypted data

The projects can be run on local computer and on testnets if applicable.

## Objective #2: MVP

TBD
