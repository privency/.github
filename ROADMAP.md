# Roadmap

This roadmap is continuously updated.

## Note

## Continuously

- blogging every week about the advancement of the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/zkorum/weekly-updates)
- posting short updates few times a week on LinkedIn and Twitter and post links to the blog posts
- eventually doing 1 or 2 tutorial / video explainer
- trying to speak at conferences

## Objective #1: proof-of-concept

Deadline

- the 1st of August 2023 (~3 months of work)

Goals:

- Convince potential users, collaborators, investors and myself of ZKorum's vision & technical viability

Non-goals:

- good software quality (successful or not, the PoC will be thrown away)
- high number of features
- beautiful design
- production-grade security (though we must convince that ZKorum _can_ be secure, given enough engineering time)

The PoC consists of independent open-source projects to showcase:

- VC-based voting ==> technical feasibility is 99% approved, actual implementation is 50% there
- a text anonymizer that can run on frontend (or that can run on encrypted data) ==> not started yet

### Result

## Objective #2: MVP

Product Design was recently prototyped on Figma. More to come here soon.
